commit 1fdb3e36ff379e5b3b05a00d49b6081435df727a

    abseil-string-find-str-contains should not propose an edit for the three-parameter version of find().
    
    std::string, std::string_view, and absl::string_view all have a three-parameter version of find()
    which has a "count" (or "n") paremeter limiting the size of the substring to search.  We don't want
    to propose changing to absl::StrContains in those cases.  This change fixes that and adds unit tests
    to confirm.
