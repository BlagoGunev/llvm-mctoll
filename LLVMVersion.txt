    [clang CodeGen] Don't crash on large atomic function parameter.
    
    I wouldn't recommend writing code like the testcase; a function
    parameter isn't atomic, so using an atomic type doesn't really make
    sense.  But it's valid, so clang shouldn't crash on it.
    
    The code was assuming hasAggregateEvaluationKind(Ty) implies Ty is a
    RecordType, which isn't true.  Just use isRecordType() instead.
